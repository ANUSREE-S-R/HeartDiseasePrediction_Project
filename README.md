# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project predicts whether a person is at risk of **heart disease** using **Machine Learning** techniques.
The model analyzes medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate to make predictions.

## Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
Early prediction can help in timely medical intervention and better treatment planning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient health information including:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Maximum heart rate
- Fasting blood sugar

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest (based on implementation)
- Binary classification (Heart Disease: Yes / No)

## Results
- The model successfully predicts the presence of heart disease.
- Achieved good accuracy on test data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning** can be applied in the healthcare domain to predict heart disease risk and support medical decision-making.
